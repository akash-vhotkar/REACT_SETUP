configulation file named as .eslintrc



Environments - which environments your script is designed to run in. 

extends 
A plugin on the other
hand provides you with a set of rules that you can individually apply depending on your need

parser section 
A parser just reads a text into an internal, 
more abstract representation, often a tree or graph of some sort.
in out example we using babel as parser which  es6 into es5 

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code 
into 
a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
Rules 

example 
 "parser": "@babel/eslint-parser"

parser options that are passed into the our current parser

"parserOptions": {
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    },
    "ecmaVersion": 12,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },

Then rules were we are declaring rules of the eslint 







prerequesites install  eslint globally 



step  1
npx eslint  --init 
After these command they cmd will ask some questions 
answer that then  all peer dependecies will installed for the  eslint javascript formatter 

step 2
check whether the eslint extension is installed  
check whether the eslint extenstion option is enable 
if not  please do 

step 3
settings
go to settings of vscode change your default formatter to eslint 
we need to eslint fix all the issues on the saving the code 
mark tick on the format on save option  on vscode settings ooptions
past below code into settings.json of the vscode 


{
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    },
    "eslint.validate": ["javascript"]
}




error - produces a red underline
warn - will produce a yellow underline
off - will not display anything.

off rule 
After applying off rule the eslint does not show the any error 
"no-console": "off"

error example 
telling eslint show error on something 
if dont want double quotes into our code 
["error", "double "]

Rule example 

  "quotes": [
        "error",
        "double"
    ]
Now, if you include single quotes in your quote, ESLint will raise an error.


what is always in the eslint

example 
in these example eslint will show error when we dont have the semicolon at the end of the line
 "semi": ["error", "always"],
